- Apply the YAML file to deploy application's backend API

`oc create -f 3_deploy_backend_api.yaml`{{execute}}

- In order for the frontend app to reach the backend API, set ``BACKEND_URL`` environment variable as a config map, by executing the following commands

`echo "env = {BACKEND_URL: 'http://$(oc get route -n e-library -o=jsonpath="{.items[0]['spec.host']}")'}" > env.js`{{execute}}

`oc create configmap -n e-library env.js --from-file=env.js`{{execute}}

- Finally deploy the frontend application

`oc create -f 4_deploy_frontend_app.yaml`{{execute}}

At this point our frontend and backend applications are deployed and are configured to use Elasticsearch

- To verify execute the following commands. If pod is not in Running status, allow a few minutes to start it cleanly.

`oc get po,svc,route `{{execute}}
